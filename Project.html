         <h2> 🏙️“Chirasmriti: A city of Eternal Memory”</h2>
 <p>Earlier in this course, a barren land of approximately 1500 sq km was designated for conversion into a smart city. Like other cities around the world, this city will require basic facilities such as infrastructure, healthcare, education, electricity, water systems, and many more. The conceptual design was developed by the team . The development of the city is divided into three phases, with the first phase primarily focusing on the establishment of an efficient and sustainable transportation system connecting different parts of the city. This transportation system includes road paving and the development of metro tracks. Hence, the domain of smart metro transportation was chosen.
What makes metro transportation "smart"? 
The integration of advanced technologies to address challenges such as optimizing time scheduling, developing efficient route networks, constructing sustainable railway infrastructure, and effectively managing passenger flow forms the core definition of a smart metro transportation system. However, upon analyzing "The Streets" (white sheet paper), it became clear that these are not the only factors that contribute to making transportation truly smart.The sustainability and stability of the system also contribute significantly to its "smart" nature. The designs introduced must be stable enough to handle future growth. For example, if the population increases exponentially in the coming years, the metro system should remain functional and efficient. The infrastructure must be capable of balancing increased demand. All these considerations were realised after analyzing the white sheet paper.
Through this project, we have aimed to integrate and implement the course topics that are relevant to the development of the city.
